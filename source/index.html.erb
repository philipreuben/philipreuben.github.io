My Services
</h2>
<p>
Expert localization of literature and visual media from an experienced translator with an eye for the smaller details.
</p>
<p>
My translation philosophy puts the target audience first to make sure they experience your art in the best possible way â€“ with the best possible localized text.
<p>
I have experience of translating into both British and American English. I'm currently seeking new clients for all kinds of creative translation in both language pairs, but especially for German to English subtitling. Please get in touch! [email]

<h2>
Background
</h2>

<p>
From 2009 I worked in-house at Nintendo of Europe, where I played a major role in highly regarded localization projects such as Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story and Super Smash Bros. For several years I also served in a project management role, overseeing in-house and outsourced localization projects, before leaving in late 2019 to pursue a career as a freelance translator.
</p>
<p>
My MA course and my ten years of industry experience have taught me the importance of understanding the client's needs and accounting for all those tiny details that can make a huge difference to the end user.
</p>
<p>
In my spare time I have performed on stage in both English and German, appearing in local productions ranging from Shakespeare to musicals to improvised Agatha Christie plays. I'm currently based in Leeds, UK.
